A simple NGINX conf tool (requires 1.8+)
Coding time consumed around 2hours total, with testing :)
Creates reverse proxy configs, static vhost configs, PHP vhost configs (via FPM, own pool per domain), MySQL users/DB
Run with -h or peek into source for switches
Copyleft, Edit if you want (pull would be nice) - Need to verify IP(4|6) and SSL cert still
MySQL requires either edit or a /root/.my.cnf file with a user authorized to create DBs/Users
